# Using webUI with your ChicagoCrimeFun
In theory, if you have a `ChicagoCrimeFun.py` file, you can use the `web.py` file with no changes.
It should just work.:tm:

If you've implemented methods differently than our `MinHeap` (see `heap.py`), you may have to change methods like `/pending` in the `web.py` file.
