# Our reflections

## Matt
* Libraries can fail in weird ways (`gmplot` seems to fail if the output name isn't `map.html`????)
    * Same for `webbrowser` opening two tabs?
* Web-apps take a *lot* of thinking. Good lord. Also, cookies would probably solve the some of the homepage issue if I could figure out how to do that.
